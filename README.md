# Incident-Report-

An attacker exploited an unconfigured firewall to launch a DDoS attack using a flood of ICMP packets, disrupting internal network services for two hours. This repository outlines our step-by-step approach using the NIST CSF to recover from the attack and prevent future occurrences.

Lessons Learned:

Configuration gaps can have major impactsâ€”regular audits are critical.
Monitoring and detection tools must be proactive and layered.
Fast, structured response based on a tested plan limits downtime and damage.

Future Enhancements:

Automate configuration checks and alerting for misconfigurations.
Expand monitoring to cover additional protocols and behaviors.
Conduct regular tabletop and live incident response exercises.
